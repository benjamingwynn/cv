<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>DataCapture Ltd. (2021-2024)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Lead the design and development of &quot;Designer,&quot; a cutting-edge web
    app enabling direct manipulation of Svelte source code files through an
    intuitive WYSIWYG graphical interface
  </li>
  <li>
    Implemented a high-performance build &amp; deployment application using
    Docker and esbuild, drastically reducing update cycles, decreasing
    onboarding time for server maintenance and enhancing efficiency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Initiated and headed the transformative restructuring of our system&#39;s
    backend into two separate processes: Data Acquisition System (DAS) and Core.
    This pioneering model allowed for more efficient web requests and
    probing/data storing, facilitating enhanced network scalability. This model
    permitted individual DAS units to monitor specific devices and utilized a
    robust communication relationship between DAS and Core using UDP datagrams
    and websockets. This major project not only enhanced system functionality
    but also retained the flexibility for local or multi-server application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the development experience, adding a hot-reloading feature in both
    the web server and web frontend. This adjustment fast-tracked the
    development process by reloading the system automatically upon file changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Led the development of a custom CI/CD solution, which significantly upgraded
    our project management system by providing a comprehensive history of unit
    test failures and creating a standardized testing environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spearheaded the overhaul of our session handling system and introduced
    standard practices such as cookie signing to enhance security.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ported across languages, from JavaScript/Python 2 to Typescript, and React
    to Svelte.
  </li>
</ul>

    project laid the foundation for my later contributions to DataCapture&#39;s
    Designer tool.
  </li>
