With this revamped skills section, your CV gains a clear structure, with a special emphasis on your proficiency in Typescript/Javascript/Node.js, achieved alongside other competencies in backend and system administration work.

The separate lists of technical and soft skills allow hiring managers to quickly gauge your technical background, but also see that you can manage teams, coordinate projects, and make strategic decisions, key requirements for high-level positions.

However, there are a couple of things that merit attention:

1. Be cautious to not sound too self-promotional. Phrases such as 'unprecedented agility', 'leads and benchmarks the highest standards of technical communication' and 'exceptional mentor' can sound a little over the top. Aim for a balance between showcasing your substantial skills set and not being overly modest.

2. Each bullet point should be clearly and concisely stated and make sure to back these skills up with examples in your work experiences or cover letter. For example, when you talk about leadership capabilities, you should show where you've managed a team or a project in your work history.

3. It may be more effective to frame your soft skills in terms your impact rather than list them out. Hiring managers prefer to understand what outcomes you have achieved with these skills. Add context and where possible, measurable results.

4. Triple check spelling and grammar. While presently there are no errors, a single typo can make a major difference in the professional quality of your CV.

Overall, the updated skills section will drive home your unique pairing of profound technical skills and leadership abilities, further making you an appealing candidate for senior developer roles.
