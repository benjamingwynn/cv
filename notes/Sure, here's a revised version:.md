My Name Here

Ambitious Computer Scientist with a robust understanding of web technologies and Linux-based solutions. I have a solid record in leading the adaptation and modernization of systems, raising software performance, spearheading the creation of sophisticated tools aimed at saving time and resources, installing efficient development processes and assuming leadership roles. I have sharpened abilities in team management, documentation, and carrying out peer reviews.

## Skills

- Proficient in numerous programming languages, including Python, C++, Typescript/Javascript, CSS, C#, and Java.
- Expert in both SQL (Mysql, Postgresql, Rethinkdb) and NOSQL (MongoDB, Cloud Bigtable) databases.
- Substantial knowledge in Git, active contributor on Github with over 60+ open-source repositories.
- Familiar with handling RHEL, Debian, and Ubuntu servers. Trained in Linux system administration with tools like systemd and bash scripting.
- Adept in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines and automated testing strategies.
- Well versed in managing Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud services, and AWS and continually keeping up-to-date with new web technologies and paradigms such as serverless and Docker-based approaches.
- Excellent in technical communication with a proven track record in writing engaging technical documents and being an active contributor to development forums.

## Work Experience

### DataCapture Ltd.

- Primary contributions included modernizing an 8-year-old JavaScript backend server to the more efficient Typescript 5.
- Developed a graphical interface called "Designer". This innovative editing tool streamlined the creation of Svelte pages and components, reducing development time by a factor of 10.
- Steered the evolution of our platform's deployments using Docker, enhancing efficiency and decreasing onboarding time for server maintenance.
- Rolled out a high-performance build & deployment application using Docker and esbuild, drastically reducing update cycles and facilitating rollouts.
- Implemented a hot-reloading feature in both the web server and web frontend. This change expedited the development process by reloading the system automatically upon file changes.
- Led the development of a custom CI/CD solution, which significantly enhanced our project management system by providing a detailed history of unit test failures and creating a standardized testing environment.
- Spearheaded the overhaul of our backend's login and session handling system and introduced standard practices such as cookie signing to enhance security.

### Other Experience

- Junior Developer at Lincoln Student Union, where priorities included team communication, documentation creation, and PHP code review.
- Full-stack Developer at Benjamin Gwynn Design, a freelance experience during which I created memehub.com from scratch and designed an interactive HTML5 worksheet - the 'Worksheet Canvas'. The project laid the foundation for my later contributions to DataCapture's Designer tool.
- Provided support at Ikona IT Ltd. as part of a temporary role aiding local companies with their Windows-based IT infrastructure.
