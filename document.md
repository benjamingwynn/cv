## Background

I've been developing open source software since 2012, starting with Android ROM development and progressing into a successful web development career, focusing on the full web stack, from the user to the browser to the database.

My professional work ranges from helping brick and mortar stores get online, to high-performance real-time data processing on critical industrial systems.

I enjoy contributing to open source and have an extensive Github history of personal projects and achievements. I thrive in small, dynamic teams, but I'm open to new experiences and always eager to learn.

My strongest skills are in native frontend browser technologies, and typescript on node.js for the backend. But I pride myself on being able to learn new programming languages and frameworks quickly to an in-depth level.

## Objective

I am seeking a remote senior full-stack engineering role, or senior DevOps role, to continue to build and maintain scalable and secure web applications.

I bring extensive experience across frontend and backend systems, strong architectural design skills, and a proven track record of improving performance and security in production environments.
