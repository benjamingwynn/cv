## Work Experience

### DataCapture Ltd. (2022-2024)

- Led the design and development of "Designer," a cutting-edge web app enabling direct manipulation of Svelte source code files through an intuitive WYSIWYG graphical interface
- Implemented a high-performance build & deployment application using Docker and esbuild, drastically reducing update cycles, decreasing onboarding time for server maintenance and enhancing efficiency.
- Initiated and headed the transformative restructuring of our system's backend into two separate processes: Data Acquisition System (DAS) and Core. This pioneering model allowed for more efficient web requests and probing/data storing, facilitating enhanced network scalability. This model permitted individual DAS units to monitor specific devices and utilized a robust communication relationship between DAS and Core using UDP datagrams and websockets. This major project not only enhanced system functionality but also retained the flexibility for local or multi-server application.
- Responsible for handling DevOps - implementing features such as hot reload, autoformatting and type-safety into our existing stack.
- Led the development of a custom CI/CD solution, which significantly upgraded our project management system by providing a comprehensive history of unit test failures and creating a standardized testing environment.
- Spearheaded the overhaul of our session handling system and introduced standard practices such as cookie signing to enhance security.
- Ported industrial device protocol code (i.e. modbus, OPC) from various languages (C#, Python, Java and PHP) to native Typescript implementations.

### Other Experience

- Junior Developer at Lincoln Student Union (2020), where priorities included team communication, documentation creation, and PHP code review.
- Full-stack Developer at Benjamin Gwynn Design (2015 - 2018), a freelance experience during which I led various projects
  - Led the development an interactive HTML5 maths worksheet editing tool - the 'Worksheet Canvas' for BigBrainMaths. The project laid the foundation for my later contributions to DataCapture's Designer tool.
  - Worked on bespoke software for small businesses including game studios, local brick-and-mortar shops and online stores.
  - Worked on custom components for large companies such as Capital Law and Admiral Insurance
- Provided support at Ikona IT Ltd. (2014) as part of a temporary role aiding local companies with their Windows-based IT infrastructure.

## Education & Training

- BSc Computer Science, University of Lincoln (2018 - 2021)
  - Dissertation: "pkgnet: A Decentralized Package Manager for Linux Code Repositories"
    - Conducted a comprehensive analysis and developed a solution to enhance Linux software distribution efficiency using a peer-to-peer networking model.
    - Designed and implemented a standardized method for building and sharing pre-compiled software binaries, promoting a scalable, secure, and independent distribution mechanism.
    - Demonstrated the potential of a decentralized approach in reducing dependencies on centralized servers and handling version control disparities across Linux systems.
    - Employed Node.js and WebTorrent technology for the development of the pkgnet daemon (`pkgnetd`) and CLI tool (`pkgnet-cli`), ensuring cross-platform compatibility and leveraging modern web technologies.
    - The project underscored the significance of compiler optimizations and the strategic management of package releases, aiming to streamline the software delivery process for Linux environments.
  - Modules included: Cloud Computing (with Google Cloud), Machine Learning, Big Data, Network Fundamentals, Parallel Programming, Logic & Computation.
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (2020)
- CertHe Computer Science (2019) - First
