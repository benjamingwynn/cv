## Professional Experience

### Remote Web Application Developer, DataCapture Ltd. (2021-2024)

- Architected and led the team for developing "Designer", a cutting-edge web app enabling direct manipulation of Svelte source code files through an intuitive WYSIWYG graphical interface
- Implemented a high-performance build & deployment application using Docker and esbuild, drastically reducing update cycles, decreasing onboarding time for server maintenance and enhancing efficiency.
- Initiated and headed the transformative restructuring of our system's backend into two separate processes: Data Acquisition System (DAS) and Core. This pioneering model allowed for more efficient web requests and probing/data storing, facilitating enhanced network scalability. This model permitted individual DAS units to monitor specific devices and utilized a robust communication relationship between DAS and Core using UDP datagrams and websockets. This major project not only enhanced system functionality but also retained the flexibility for local or multi-server application.
- Responsible for handling DevOps - implementing features such as hot reload, autoformatting and type-safety into our existing stack.
- Individually led the development of a custom CI/CD solution, which significantly upgraded our project management system by providing a comprehensive history of unit test failures and creating a standardized testing environment.
- Spearheaded the overhaul of our session handling system and introduced standard practices such as cookie signing to enhance security.
- Handled industrial device protocols for compatibility with existing SCADA infrastructure, employing reverse engineering and optimisation techniques.

### Other Experience

- Junior Developer at Lincoln Student Union (2020), where priorities included team communication, documentation creation, and PHP code review.
- Full-stack Developer at Benjamin Gwynn Design (2015 - 2018), a freelance experience during which I led various projects
	- Led the development an interactive HTML5 maths worksheet editing tool - the 'Worksheet Canvas' for BigBrainMaths. The project laid the foundation for my later contributions to DataCapture's Designer tool.
	- Worked on bespoke software for small businesses including game studios, local brick-and-mortar shops and online stores.
	- Worked on custom components for large companies such as Capital Law and Admiral Insurance
	- Setup and provided support for SME's on AWS and Azure, providing bespoke serverless solutions.
- Provided support at Ikona IT Ltd. (2014) as part of a temporary role aiding local companies with their Windows-based IT infrastructure.

## Education & Training

	- Modules included: Cloud Computing (with Google Cloud), Machine Learning, Big Data, Network Fundamentals, Parallel Programming, Logic & Computation.
	- Dissertation: "pkgnet: A Decentralized Package Manager for Linux Code Repositories"
		- Conducted a comprehensive analysis and developed a solution to enhance Linux software distribution efficiency using a peer-to-peer networking model, underscoring the significance of compiler optimizations and management of package releases, aiming to streamline the software delivery process.
		- Designed and implemented a standardized method for building and sharing pre-compiled software binaries, promoting a scalable, secure, and independent distribution mechanism.
		- Demonstrated the potential of a decentralized approach in reducing dependencies on centralized servers and handling version control disparities across Linux systems.
		- Employed Node.js and WebTorrent technology for the development of the pkgnet daemon (`pkgnetd`) and CLI tool (`pkgnet-cli`), ensuring cross-platform compatibility and leveraging modern web technologies.
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (2020)
- CertHe Computer Science (2019)
